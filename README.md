# External Maxscript Listener

You can use this plugin to execute Maxscript commands or evaluate Maxscript files from outside of Max. 

Make sure Max is running and the plugin is initialized before running SendMaxscript.exe, otherwise you will see this:

If everything is working correctly you should see this:

You can type any Maxscript command in there or evaluate entire scripts.
